### Procedure

Test Procedure of Reynolds experiment is as follows:<br>
•	Start the Motor by clicking on the motor button.<br>
•	Now fill the reservoir with a dye (generally potassium permanganate solution) which is nothing but coloured fluid. The weight density of dye should be same as that of water.<br>
•	Open the dye tank valve to allow flow of dye through glass tube.<br>
•	Allow the flow of water through the glass tube at a very low rate by partially opening the outlet valve of a glass tube.<br>
• Observe the appearance of dye filament in the glass tube and note down the type of flow obtained for that particular discharge.<br>
•	Now, close the gate valve for measuring flow rate.<br>
•	Take a stopwatch and note down the volume of water collected in measuring tank for 50 sec.<br>
•	Repeat the above procedure for different discharge rates and calculate Reynolds’s number for each type of flow and analyse the flow pattern change with reynolds number.<br>
