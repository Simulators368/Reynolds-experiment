### Procedure

Test Procedure of Reynolds experiment is as follows:
•	Fill the tank with water and leave it for some time as the water in the tank should come to rest.
•	Now fill the reservoir with a dye (generally potassium permanganate solution) which is nothing but coloured fluid. The weight density of dye should be same as that of water.
•	Record the temperature of water.
•	Allow the flow through the glass tube at a very low rate by partially opening the outlet valve of a glass tube.
•	When the flow is stable, open the inlet valve of dye injector and allow the coloured fluid to flow through the glass tube.
•	Observe the appearance of dye filament in the glass tube and note down the type of flow obtained for that particular discharge.
•	Take a stopwatch and note down the volume of water collected in measuring for 50 sec.
•	Repeat the above procedure for different discharge rates and calculate Reynolds’s number for each type of flow.
