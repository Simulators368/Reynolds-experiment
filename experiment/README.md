### Aim
Determine the Reynolds number and study different types of flow according to the Reynolds number
### Theory
'Reynolds number' is the ratio of the inertial force of flowing fluid to the viscous force of the fluid. Inertial force of the fluid can be expressed as:<br>

 Inertial force, Fi = mass × acceleration<br>
                                = (density × volume) × (Velocity / time)<br>
       = (density × Area) × (Velocity × Velocity)<br>

Viscous force, Fv = Shear stress × area<br>

Therefore, Reynolds number is given by:<br>

Where, v = velocity of fluid flow<br>
D = diameter of glass tube<br>
ρ = Density of fluid<br>
µ = Dynamic viscosity of fluid<br>
γ = Kinematic viscosity of fluid<br>

<h5>Apparatus Required:</h5>
•	A Tank filled with water<br>
•	A small reservoir filled with coloured fluid or dye<br>
•	A glass tube with bell-mouth entrance<br>
•	A measuring tank<br>
•	Regulating valve at the outlet of glass tube and at inlet of dye injector<br>
•	A stopwatch<br>

### Procedure
Test Procedure of Reynolds experiment is as follows:<br>
•	Fill the tank with water and leave it for some time as the water in the tank should come to rest.<br>
•	Now fill the reservoir with a dye (generally potassium permanganate solution) which is nothing but coloured fluid. The weight density of dye should be same as that of water.<br>
•	Record the temperature of water.<br>
•	Allow the flow through the glass tube at a very low rate by partially opening the outlet valve of a glass tube.<br>
•	When the flow is stable, open the inlet valve of dye injector and allow the coloured fluid to flow through the glass tube.<br>
•	Observe the appearance of dye filament in the glass tube and note down the type of flow obtained for that particular discharge.<br>
•	Take a stopwatch and note down the volume of water collected in measuring for 50 sec.<br>
•	Repeat the above procedure for different discharge rates and calculate Reynolds’s number for each type of flow.<br>
