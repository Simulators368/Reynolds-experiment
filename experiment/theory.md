### Theory

'Reynolds number' is the ratio of the inertial force of flowing fluid to the viscous force of the fluid. Inertial force of the fluid can be expressed as:<br>
Inertial force, Fi = mass × acceleration
                                = (density × volume) × (Velocity / time)
       = (density × Area) × (Velocity × Velocity)
 
Viscous force, Fv = Shear stress × area
 
Therefore, Reynolds number is given by:

 
Where, v = velocity of fluid flow
D = diameter of glass tube
ρ = Density of fluid
µ = Dynamic viscosity of fluid
γ = Kinematic viscosity of fluid

Apparatus Required:<br>
•	A Tank filled with water<br>
•	A small reservoir filled with coloured fluid or dye<br>
•	A glass tube with bell-mouth entrance<br>
•	A measuring tank<br>
•	Regulating valve at the outlet of glass tube and at inlet of dye injector<br>
•	A stopwatch<br>
