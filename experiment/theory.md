### Theory

'Reynolds number' is the ratio of the inertial force of flowing fluid to the viscous force of the fluid. Inertial force of the fluid can be expressed as:<br>

 Inertial force, Fi = mass × acceleration<br>
                                = (density × volume) × (Velocity / time)<br>
       = (density × Area) × (Velocity × Velocity)<br>

Viscous force, Fv = Shear stress × area<br>

Therefore, Reynolds number is given by:<br>

Where, v = velocity of fluid flow<br>
D = diameter of glass tube<br>
ρ = Density of fluid<br>
µ = Dynamic viscosity of fluid<br>
γ = Kinematic viscosity of fluid<br>
