#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concepts and Data Analysis.

   By this experiment we want student to understand the flow patterns (i.e laminar, Transient, and Turbulent) with Change of Reynolds number. By doing this experiment they will themselve analyse the flow patterns change with increase or decrease of flow rate. Also student will be able to understand the significance of Reynolds number by performing experiment.
         
         
#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level

<h5>Description:</h5>
Here we have identified three learning objectives. As this experiment is based on the universal laws for the subjects therefore it includes remembering of the theorem and facts and then operation or execution the experiment. Further during the operation student will be able to understand the theorem and further based on the observations students will be able to to analyse and reach the outcome.
<br>

<h5>Method:</h5>
To achieve attainment of all the objectives the experiment is designed for different sets of flow rates so that students may learn through performing.
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>recall the Reynolds number | Remember | recall
2.| User will be able to: <br>understand the Reynolds Number and its significance. | Understand | Understand
3.| User will be able to: <br> analyse the type of flow according to the Reynolds number calculated. | Analyse| Analyse

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>  Expository
###### Assessment Method: Submmative

<h5>DESCRIPTION:</h5>
Step by step instructions are provided at each level in the simulator to make it more user friendly.

<h5>SCOPE:</h5>
Various changes in flow rate are possible so that user may completely learn the objective.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| LO3| Identify the flow pattern when experimental is running by visualising through simulator.| Which type of fluid flow is smooth, and predictable? <br>a)	Turbulent<br>b)	Viscous<br> <b>c)	Laminar</b> <br> <b>d)	Inertial</b> <br> 
2.| LO1, LO2 and LO3 | Find the value of Reynold's number at a particular flow rate and identify flow pattern. | What value of Reynolds number indicates laminar flow?  <br> a)	2000 <br>b)	5000<br>c)	7000<br>d)	10000<br>  
3.| LO1, LO2 and LO3 | Recalling, understanding and analysing the flow pattern on the basis of Reynolds no. | Velocity within the given fields would be similar in magnitude, direction and turbulence pattern when <br>a)	Nusselt number are different<br>b)	Nusselt number are same<br>c)	Reynolds number are different<br><b>d)	Reynolds number are same</b><br>
4.| LO1, LO2 and LO3| Find the value by doing calculations according to specification in simulator and then determine flow pattern | A pipe has a diameter of 0.2 m in which a fluid flows with a velocity of 0.3 m3/s. Determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent calculating the Reynolds number. Assume kinematic viscosity = 0.5 × 10-4 m2 /s. <br>a)	the flow is laminar having Reynolds number 1200<br>b)	the flow is turbulent having Reynolds number 2100<br>c)	the flow is laminar having Reynolds number 2200<br>d)	the flow is neither laminar nor turbulent <br> 
5.| LO3 | observe the flow pattern in the simulator and apply that here.| 4.	Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a stream with laminar streamflow?  <br> a)	Quiet<br><b>b)	Water that moves quickly</b><br>c)	Water that flows in a straight line<br>d)	No visible physical barriers<br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Switch on the motor | Click on the ‘motor button  '  | to start the flow of water through the system.
2.| Student will allow the movement of dye<br> from dye tank | open the ‘dye tank valve  '  | to start the flow of dye through water, through delivery pipe.
3.| Student will regulate the water(with dye) flow<br> by rotating the valve | Click on the ‘outlet valve to rotate it '	  | To adjust/set the flow rate of water.
4.| Student will observe the flow pattern of dye flowing through middle of water through delivery pipe | Stright line of dye will appear, in the middle of the water flow for laminar flow(Reynolds no. 0 to 2000)<br> a disturbed flow of dye will appear for transient flow (Reynold's no. 2000 to 4000)<br> mixed flow of dye with water will appear for turbulent flow( Reynolds no. >4000)| To observe the flow pattern .
5.| Student will measure the height in manometer <br> by collecting the water<br> in collecting tank| Click on the ‘gate valve <br>to close it '  | To calculate the flow rate.
