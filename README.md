<b> Lab | <b> Chemical engineering fluid mechanics lab
<b> Experiment|     <b> Experiment number 2. Determine the Reynolds number and study different types of flow.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The Fluid Mechanics laboratory is designed to examine the properties of fluids and to conduct experiments involving both incompressible and compressible flow.Facilities for investigating the fundamentals of fluid statics, kinematics, kinetics of fluid flow, open channel flow and  centrifugal pumps should be available in the labs.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

Reynolds experiment description: this experiment is designed to explain the concepts of laminar , transition and turbulent flow. Students will be able to understand and diferentiate between different types of flow by actually visuallizing them.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

UG AND PG students of chemical engineering

<h5> Course Alignment : </h5>

KCH 351
