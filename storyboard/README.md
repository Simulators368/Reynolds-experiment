## Storyboard (Round 2)

Delete this line before submission : The core principle of Round 2 is to make the lab/experiment documentation elaborated in a manner that it makes easy for any person (developer/domain and non domain faculty/student) to understand and develop the lab/experiment.

Experiment 1: Name of the Experiment

### 1. Story Outline:

Describe outline Here ( guide : The proposer should first draft the story outline for the proposed outline. This could be 2 or 3 paragraphs.)

### 2. Story:

Describe the Story intorduction here (guide : The next step is to write a story. Story should be a brief logical description in simple English. It should talk about the overall execution of the experiment in a simplified manner. (should not include any equations/ drawings). The story should include the following points) )

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
In the simulator user will be able to see the virtual prototype of experimental set up resembling the actual experimental set up that is present in real time labs.
Set up consists of a Reservoir tank containing large amount of volume connected to a centrifugal pump by the help of 2 cm diameter pipe. The outlet of the pump is also connected with 2 cm diameter vertical pipe, attached to the conduit. There is a delivery valve present in between delivery pipe connecting to the conduit1. The outlet pipe of variable diameter just like venturimeter is connected from the bottom of conduit1 to the conduit2 know as duct. In the duct at regular intervals piezometers are attached for measuring pressure head. 11 piezometers are present in  duct of length 900 mm.
At the outlet of the conduit2 there is  outlet valve for regulating the flow rate through the duct. Then from the conduit 2 a pipe is attached that drops the water into the collecting tank. This collecting tank has dimensions of 40*40 cm2. This collecting tank also contains a attached manometer tube for measuring height in the tank. At the bottom side of collecting tank there is a gate valve which in close condition prevents the fall of water back into the reservoir. The reservoir is present just below the collecting tank.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
1) By this experiment student will be able to recall the Bernoulli's theorem. 
2) This experiment Describe the application of Bernoulli's theorem.
3) Student will be able to recall the velocity head and pressure head concepts.
4) To understand the change in the pressure head when flow rate is changed through calculation.
5) To understand the calculation of flow rate by measuring height in collecting tank.
6) To plot a graph taking piezometer distances on x-axis and taking total head, Velocity head, Pressure head on Y-axis.
7) Student will be able to analyse the data obtained from various sections of the pipe at different flow rates through graph.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

1) In the experimental set up, there is a centrifugal pump, delivery valve, outlet valve and gate valve. This all will be recognised by user as each have naming in the set up.
2) User will start the pump by clicking on the motor button.
3) Then user will on the delivery valve present at the delivery side of the pump. Also after that by the help of outlet valve user will regulate the flow rate of water through the duct.
4) Then by closing the gate valve student will be able to collect water in the collecting tank for measuring height by which student will understand the calculation of flow rate and will calculate the same.
5) Simulator will provide the respective heights of piezometer and other data needed for doing calculation.
6) User will do the calculation for pressure head, velocity head and total head. After doing all the calculation student will be able to recall Bernoulli's theorem. 
7) User will make a plot having piezometers distance on x-axis and taking total head, Velocity head, Pressure head on Y-axis. 
8) By the help of graph student will be able to analyse the data obtained for different flow rates.

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Describe the pitfalls here: (guide : (while traversing or while solving challenge, how will we bring a situation in front of him that he commits mistake if he is not attentive , or not following procedure , descriptive))

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
Type equations here : (guide : ( a separate sheet having equations / programs for the lab exper3ment to be shared along with the Story submissions (1) . You can mark it as numerical reference numbers within the story narration (like we cite in the research papers) and then separately share these equations/programs sheets as a reference, do not include the equations as a whole in the narration))
Tool can be used to integrate formula in Markdown <b> [here](http://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/samples/example3.php) </b>


### 3. Flowchart 4
<img src="flowchart/flowchart.png"/><br>
link to flow chart Here : Store in the  /flowchart folder within Round2 folder in your repo
<br>
(guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )

### 4. Mindmap:
<img src="mindmap/mindmap.png"/>
 Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the  /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here
 <br>
 (guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intri5acies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )

### 5. Storyboard :
Storyboard: <a href="Storyboard/carwiper.gif"> [here]</a>
Link to storybaord (.gif file ) here :
(guide: This document should include sketching and description scene wise (duration, action, description). Software to be used for storyboarding : https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/ (Its a FOSS tool) . tutorial on how to use it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAeCEpG0KX4
