## Storyboard (Round 2)

Delete this line before submission : The core principle of Round 2 is to make the lab/experiment documentation elaborated in a manner that it makes easy for any person (developer/domain and non domain faculty/student) to understand and develop the lab/experiment.

Experiment 1: Determine the Reynolds Number and study Different Types of Flow.

### 1. Story Outline:

This experiment contains fresh water in a tank and dye in other small tank placed above water tank. Water and dye will flow through delivery pipe to the reservoir via collecting tank. 
The basic objective of this experiment is to recall Reynolds number and understand the significance of Reynolds number. Also student will be able to visualize different flow patterns with Change in flow rate stream flowing through delivery pipe.

### 2. Story:

Describe the Story intorduction here (guide : The next step is to write a story. Story should be a brief logical description in simple English. It should talk about the overall execution of the experiment in a simplified manner. (should not include any equations/ drawings). The story should include the following points) )

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
In the simulator user will be able to see the virtual prototype of experimental set up resembling the actual experimental set up that is present in real time labs.
In the set up there is large volume water tank placed on stands at some distance above the ground. Above the water tank there is a small dye tank containing dye ( it can be any coloured dye) with some properties required for experiment. At bottom side of tank there is a delivery pipe connected having diameter of 0.01 m. Also from the dye tank, a pipe of very less diameter is connected to the middle of the delivery pipe at water tank side. Between dye tank and connected pipe there is a valve for controlling flow of dye. 
Then at the end of delivery pipe, there is outlet valve that is used to regulate the flow. Then there is a collecting tank having 100cm2 area in which water drops from the delivery pipe and at bottom side of this tank there is a gate valve and then a reservoir is present below that collecting to tank.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Describe the objectives and goals in details here : (guide : The user should clearly understand the aims and objective of the experiment. ( how he will begin experiment. ?  in descriptive))

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Describe the pathway activites here : (Guide : Set the pathway activities in line with the learning objectives (LOs)  & with a view to achieve the goals set in round #0 & round#1.  (once he begins, how he will traverse through the entire experiment ? in descriptive))

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Describe the pitfalls here: (guide : (while traversing or while solving challenge, how will we bring a situation in front of him that he commits mistake if he is not attentive , or not following procedure , descriptive))

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
<h5> Reynold's number:</h5>
Re= 	(ρ*v*d)/μ <br><br>
Flow Rate: Q= (Area*Height)/time<br><br>
where,
<br>
 ρ= density of fluid <br>
 μ= dynamic viscosity <br>
 d= diameter of pipe <br>
 v= velocity of fluid <br>
<br/>


### 3. Flowchart 4
<img src="flowchart/flowchart.png"/><br>
link to flow chart Here : Store in the  /flowchart folder within Round2 folder in your repo
<br>
(guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )

### 4. Mindmap:
<img src="mindmap/mindmap.png"/>
 Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the  /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here
 <br>
 (guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intri5acies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )

### 5. Storyboard :

(guide: This document should include sketching and description scene wise (duration, action, description). Software to be used for storyboarding : https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/ (Its a FOSS tool) . tutorial on how to use it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAeCEpG0KX4
